# Crown grafting
Crown grafting is one of the simplest and most popular methods of grafting. In this method of grafting, you remove a major limb or even the central trunk of a tree. You then insert scions from the desired cultivar between the bark and the wood at the crown of the stump.

Crown grafting is especially useful when you want to replace the cultivar of a fruit tree. It is most commonly performed on deciduous trees in the early spring, as trees begin to emerge from dormancy.

## Before you begin
Prepare the following tools and materials:
* Dormant branch cuttings from the desired cultivar (see [Preparing cuttings for scions](http://www.example.com))
* Knife (grafting knife or utility knife)
* Saw or shears
* Rope or cord
* Tape (grafting tape, flagging tape, or thread seal tape)
* Thin screwdriver
* Sandwich bags
* Brown paper bags
* Scissors
* Sealing compound, such as wax or tar

## To perform a crown graft
1. Choose the location where you want to perform the grafting, on the tree that will serve as rootstock. 
This can be a major limb of the tree, or even the central trunk. 
2. Using a pair of shears or a saw, cut off and discard the limb.
3. In one or more locations around the crown of the stump, use a knife and then a screwdriver to begin prying the bark from the wood. Perform this step for each of the scions that you plan to graft, at various locations around the crown. 
4. Wrap tape around the circumference of the rootstock crown, at the top of the stump.
5. Take one of your cuttings and prepare a scion from it:
    1. Remove and discard about an inch from the top and the bottom of the cutting.
    2. Cut a healthy-looking piece with 3 or 4 buds.
    3. Using a sharp knife, cut the end of the scion, away from the direction of bud growth, in a slantwise whittling motion. Do this on both sides of the scion. Ensure that the cut starts at an equal distance from the tip on both sides of the scion.
6. Wedge the scion into one of the incisions that you prepared in step 3. Push it down until only the very top of the cut is visible just above the stump.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for as many scions that you want to graft onto this stump.
8. Wind more tape around the stump to secure all scions in place.
9. Spread some beeswax or any other sealing compound on the upper surface of the stump.
10. Place a sandwich bag over the grafts and tie it to the limb of the tree with a piece of rope.
11. Place a paper bag over the sandwich bag and tie it with rope.
