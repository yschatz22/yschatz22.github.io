# Crown grafting
Crown grafting is one of the simplest and most popular methods of grafting. In this method of grafting, you remove a major limb or even the central trunk of a tree with all its vegetation. You then insert scions from the desired cultivar between the bark and the wood at the crown of the stump.

Crown grafting is especially useful when you want to replace the cultivar of a fruit tree. It is most commonly performed on deciduous trees in the early spring, as trees begin to emerge from dormancy.

## Before you begin
Prepare the following tools and materials:
* Dormant branch cuttings from the desired cultivar (see [Preparing cuttings for scions](http://www.example.com))
* Knife (grafting knife or utility knife)
* Saw or shears
* Rope or cord
* Tape
* Thin screwdriver
* Sandwich bags
* Brown paper bags
* Scissors
* Sealing compound, such as wax or tar

## To perform a crown graft
1. Using a pair of shears or a saw, cut a major limb or the central trunk of the tree that will serve as rootstock.
2. In one or more locations around the crown of the stump, use a knife and then a screwdriver to begin prying the bark from the wood. Perfom this step for each of the scions that you plan to graft, at various locations around the crown. 
3. Wrap tape (grafting tape or even thread seal tape) around the circumference of the rootstock crown, at the top of the stump.
4. Take one of your cuttings and prepare a scion from it:
    1. Remove and discard about an inch from the top and the bottom of the cutting.
    2. Cut a healthy-looking piece with 3 or 4 buds.
    3. d
5. Stick the scion in.
6. Spread some beeswax.
7. Put a sandwich bag over the grafts and tie with a string.
8. Put a paper bag over the sandwich bag and tie with a string.
