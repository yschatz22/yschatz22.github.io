# Crown grafting
Crown grafting is one of the simplest and most popular methods of grafting. In this method of grafting, you remove a major limb or even the central trunk of a tree with all vegetation. You then insert scions from the desired cultivar between the bark and the wood at the crown of the stump.

Crown grafting is especially useful when you want to replace the cultivar of a fruit tree. It is most commonly performed on deciduous trees in the early spring, as trees begin to emerge from dormancy.
